The UI design paradigm must follow is called **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**.  

### Key Aspects of Responsive Design:
1. **Fluid Grids** – Layouts are built using relative units (like percentages) rather than fixed pixels.  
2. **Flexible Images & Media** – Images and videos scale to fit their containers.  
3. **CSS Media Queries** – Different styles are applied based on device characteristics (e.g., screen width, resolution, or orientation).  

### Who Coined the Term?
The concept was popularized by **Ethan Marcotte** in his 2010 article *["Responsive Web Design"](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/)* on *A List Apart*.  

### Evolution & Related Concepts:
- **Mobile-First Design** – Designing for mobile devices first, then scaling up for larger screens.  
- **Adaptive Design** – Serving different fixed layouts (rather than fluid ones) based on device detection.  
- **Progressive Enhancement** – Starting with a baseline experience and adding enhancements for capable devices.
