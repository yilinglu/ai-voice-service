The plutus-server is running on port 3000, don't kill it. 
You can start or stop the plutus-frontend server when you need to debug or troubleshoot.

Don't make code any changes without my approval, always discuss your change plan with me, ask for approval, only implement these approved change after you get my approval.

Should we add the progressive scaling (extra boost for louder speech), or keep it simple?
Any specific target: e.g., "normal speech should reach 60-80% bar height"?

Proposed Investigation Plan
Option A: Check Layercode Voice Activity Detection
Look at Layercode SDK documentation for voice activity thresholds
Find if there's a separate "speaking" vs "audio detected" state
Option B: Add Debug Logging for Layercode States
Log when Layercode considers you "speaking" vs just "audio detected"
Compare visual amplitude vs actual voice activity detection
Option C: Make Bars Even More Dramatic (Visual Only)
10x base level boost instead of 3.5x
This won't affect Layercode audio, just visual prominence
‚ùì Which investigation should I proceed with?
The key insight: Your visual bar sensitivity and Layercode's voice pipeline are completely separate systems. The bars just show what Layercode reports, but Layercode decides independently when to process speech.
